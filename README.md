# "4R Ecological concept" project

## WHAT?

"4R Ecological concept" is an Articulate Storyline 360 project about ecological behaviour.
The project goal is to reduce the Ecological Footprint and increase ecological awareness.

This Storyline project provides Checklist Interaction, Drag and Drop interaction, Slider, and Interactive video with questions, Markers, and so on. 
During development, I used triggers, conditions, slide layers, object states, and custom buttons in Storyline 360.

## HOW?

To make this project I did:
- Needs analysis and Action map;
- Storyboard;
- Visual Mockups;
- Develop prototype in Articulate Storyline 360;
- Get feedback from my professional network;
- Develop the whole project;
- Save the project via GitHub to be able to share it with others.
